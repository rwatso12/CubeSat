NSF Funded Projects



Basic Info

	Since 2008, the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences at NSF has run a program
        to support CubeSat-based Science Missions.

	Launches are not part of the program but are provided by the DOD on a collaborative or 
        reimbursable basis and by NASA through their Educational launch program (ELaNa).

	Proposals are submitted to the program through an annual solicitation; based on scientific
        and technical peer review one to two new projects are selected each year for implementation
	out of a pool of roughly 25 proposals

	So far, the program has carried out 4 competitions resulting in a total of 10 projects. 
	Typically, the grants awarded are in the amount of $900,000 and of 3 years duration. Over 
	the first 5 years of the program (2008 - 2012), the total funding in the program was just
	below 10 million, including a one-time infusion of 2.8 million from the American Reinvestment
	and Recovery Act in 2009.
